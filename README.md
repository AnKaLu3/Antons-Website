# Anton Kühr — Robotics & Mechanical Engineering

Personal portfolio with education, experience and six engineering case studies: robotic skin, microphone implementation, a robot backpack, a rotating robot base, a voice-controlled cobot and an autonomous harvesting robot.

The website uses plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. GitHub Pages serves it directly from `main`; there is no build step or application framework.

## Local preview

With Python 3.9 or newer installed, run from the repository root:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Open [localhost:8765](http://127.0.0.1:8765/). The preview uses the same static files as the published site.

## Checks and formatting

Check local links, section IDs, structured data and sitemap entries without installing dependencies:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_site.py
```

Optional development tooling uses a pinned Prettier version. With Node.js and npm installed:

```sh
npm ci
npm run check:js
npm run format:check
npm run format
```

GitHub Actions runs these checks on pushes and pull requests to `main`. These tools do not generate or bundle the website.

## Maintenance notes

- [Development guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md): page structure, asset updates and publishing.
- [Content sources](docs/CONTENT.md): the basis and limits of project claims.
- [Asset attribution](docs/ASSETS.md): visual inspiration and logo sources.
- [Search maintenance](docs/SEO.md): canonical URLs, sitemap and verification files.

Project media and documents retain their original ownership. Organisation names and logos identify the relevant institutions, employers and technologies.
